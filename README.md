## Introduction

Having searched for many years for a usable Linux window manager that both appealed to my sense of aesthetics and had at least some of the features I feel necessary for a 'proper' WM; in all that time I only came across one which, at least partially, fit the bill. 

`Mavosxwm` was the creation of `Martin Vollrathson` and hadn't been updated since sometime in 2003. After obtaining permission from him in 2007, I forked Mavosxwm v0.2.1 to use as the base from which I will write `koWm`. I will be keeping parts of the window interface, the theming mechanism, and some of the event-handling code; these bits are, even now, making their way into various locations in kowm-core.

For the record, kowm itself stands for `Kobol's Own Window Manager`; in like manner all related icons, artwork, and documentation should reflect this. 

The modules themselves are to be named for the twelve colonies of man and various non-aligned colonies from the original BattleStar Galactica, circa 1978-1979. 

## kowm
`kowm` ( /kōm/ ) never wanted to be anything more when she grew up than the only X window manager that even I would take home to Mom. kowm has decided that 'extensible simplicity' is the wave of the future; and we tend to agree. 

## kowm-core
`kowm-core` is made up of six modular desktop libraries; five handle the basic features that make for a beautifully simple window manager and the sixth is a framework for building, attaching, and manipulating new modular extensions. Since speed is of the essence here, we're planning on writing kowm-core in C++.
-  :capricorn: caprica provides low-level constructs shared by all 'windows'; including the root window.
-  :gemini: gemoni provide basic workspace management and functionality.
-  :leo: leonis provides the graphics subsystem from which all graphics toolkit modules can hook into and manipulate objects.
-  :sagittarius: sagitara provides a basic module structure, attachment points and shared asset management funtions.
-  :pisces: piscera provides automatic menu generation of the system menu, the desktop menu and the application menus.
-  :virgo: virgon provides all remaining mid- and high-level 'window' management

## kowm-opts
komw-opts /kōm-äpts/ currently has six additional modular libraries planned. These libraries - along with any others we think are needed - will provide additional services that, while not absolutely necessary, would probably be appreciated by the end user. These libraries will most likely be written in Ruby; however additional bindings for Python and Lua are currently on the RoadMap.
-  :aries: aeries provides ...
-  :aquarius: aquarus provides ...
-  :libra: libris provides ...
-  :cancer: orion provides ...
-  :scorpius: scorpion provides ...
-  :taurus: taura provides ...

## kowm-apps
Finally, we're planning other apps the we deem useful to the overall desktop experience. These will reside within the `kowm-apps` project. kowm-apps can use any language for which exists a language binding or a new one if you or a friend have the knowledge to write one; don't fret too much, it's not a difficult task. That being said, we definitely are expecting the first few to be all Ruby.
-  :clock1: acheron provides ...
-  :clock2: erebos provides ...
-  :clock3: hestia provides ...
-  :clock4: icarus provides ...
-  :clock5: kronos provides ...
-  :clock6: ouranos provides ...
-  :clock7: pallas provides ...
-  :clock8: persephone provides ...
-  :clock9: phoebe provides ...
-  :clock10: styx provides ...
-  :clock11: thanatos provides ...
-  :clock12: troy provides ...

## So, to recap...
-	Want to make a new application or extension for kowm?
	-	Simply, write your new module in any of the available language bindings already written. 
-	No binding for the language you prefer to code in?
	-	Well then, write yourself a binding module for that language and continue on.

Oh yeah, one last thing I'd like to say... please... don't forget to submit a pull request once you're done, so others can enjoy the new language, application, or extension you just made possible.
